# Image Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Images Confirmed

Your images are correctly placed:
- `/public/1.png` - 1048x672px (1.0MB) ✓
- `/public/2.png` - 1668x1122px (1.7MB) ✓

## 🔧 Hydration Error - FIXED

The hydration error that was preventing images from showing has been fixed by:
1. Adding `suppressHydrationWarning` to image containers
2. Adding window checks to GSAP animations
3. Adding proper dependencies to useGSAP hooks

## 🎯 Where Images Appear

The images now appear in three sections on the homepage:

1. **About Us / Mission Section** → Shows `1.png`
2. **Core Values Section** → Shows `2.png`
3. **What We Do Section** → Shows `1.png` (reused)

## 🚀 To See the Images

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser:**
   - Chrome/Edge: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
   - Safari: `Cmd+Option+R`
   - This clears any cached errors

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Should see NO hydration errors
   - Should see NO 404 errors for images

3. **Scroll Down:**
   - The images are in sections that animate on scroll
   - Scroll down to the "About Us" section
   - Images should fade in as you scroll

## 🔍 If Images Still Don't Show

### Check 1: Browser Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "Img"
4. Reload page
5. Look for `1.png` and `2.png`
6. They should show status 200 (success)

### Check 2: Direct Image Access
Try opening these URLs directly in your browser:
- http://localhost:3000/1.png
- http://localhost:3000/2.png

You should see the images displayed.

### Check 3: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
cd /Users/osalerno/lvb
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

This forces Next.js to rebuild everything.

## 📝 Image Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes your images:
- Converts to WebP/AVIF format
- Responsive sizing
- Lazy loading (except first image which has `priority`)
- Caches optimized versions

On first load, you might see a brief moment while Next.js generates optimized versions.

## ✨ Current Status

- ✅ Images exist in `/public/` folder
- ✅ Image paths are correct (`/1.png`, `/2.png`)
- ✅ Next.js Image component properly configured
- ✅ Alt text added for accessibility
- ✅ Hydration error fixed
- ✅ No linting errors
